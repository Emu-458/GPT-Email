  "issues": {
    "Serious Illicit Cigarette Problem": [
      "The expansion of the illicit cigarette market has become a serious public policy issue. Overly restricting legal tobacco products will only push consumers toward unregulated black-market products, resulting in tax revenue losses.",
      "Current policies have led many smokers to purchase illicit cigarettes, which are unregulated and may contain harmful substances, posing greater health risks.",
      "The government should strengthen border controls, enhance enforcement against cigarette smuggling, and impose harsher penalties on illegal tobacco trade.",
      "Data shows that the illicit cigarette market is continuously expanding—does this indicate a failure of government strategy? Should excessively strict policies be reconsidered?",
      "The goal of tobacco control is to protect public health, but excessive restrictions are driving smokers towards illicit markets, exposing them to even higher risks."
    ],
    "Excessively High Tobacco Tax": [
      "Further increasing tobacco taxes will impose greater economic pressure on low-income groups and may drive more people to the illegal tobacco market.",
      "Tobacco taxes are already exorbitantly high, prompting many smokers to opt for cheaper illicit tobacco products, which impacts government tax revenues.",
      "The government should focus on providing better smoking cessation support, such as reducing the cost of cessation products and offering free cessation counseling, rather than simply raising tobacco taxes.",
      "Every time the government increases the tobacco tax, more smokers turn to the black market to buy illicit cigarettes. The tax increase has not significantly reduced the smoking rate, nor has it greatly increased tax revenue, so it is clear that it is ineffective.",
      "Excessive tobacco taxes only increase promote black market transactions, providing no positive help for citizens to quit smoking."
    ],
    "Ban on Flavored Tobacco Products": [
      "Banning flavored tobacco products may lead consumers to turn to illicit cigarette markets rather than effectively reducing smoking rates.",
      "The government should focus on education and smoking cessation support rather than simply banning flavored tobacco, to avoid unintentionally encouraging black-market trade.",
      "When the legal market fails to meet consumer demand, the illegal market naturally rises, leading to more severe public health risks.",
      "In a mature society, adults should have the right to choose rather than being unilaterally deprived of legal product options by the government."
    ],
    "Ban on E-cigarettes and Heated Tobacco Products": [
      "Many countries have recognized e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products as harm reduction tools and have implemented regulations to ensure their safety.",
      "If the government completely bans e-cigarettes and heated tobacco, many smokers may revert to traditional cigarettes, leading to more severe health issues.",
      "A black market for e-cigarette products may emerge, and these unregulated products could contain even more dangerous substances.",
      "The government should establish strict regulatory measures rather than outright banning e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products to safeguard public health.",
      "Many smokers have successfully reduced their use of traditional cigarettes or even quit smoking through e-cigarettes; the government should provide appropriate choices."
    ],
    "Ban on Shisha (Waterpipe)": [
      "Shisha has a certain market in bars and the catering industry. A total ban would economically impact related industries, affecting employment and consumption.",
      "A strict ban on shisha may lead to the expansion of illegal markets, allowing unregulated products to enter circulation, thereby increasing health risks.",
      "Instead of outright banning shisha, the government could implement a licensing system to allow designated venues to legally offer shisha services.",
      "Shisha has become a cultural trend in Hong Kong and neighboring cities—has the government considered this phenomenon?",
      "Many people view shisha as a social activity. A direct ban may not effectively reduce its use but could drive people to unregulated venues."
    ],
    "Expansion of No-smoking Areas Without Providing Legal Smoking Zones": [
      "The “trainhead” phenomenon reflects a gap in public space management. Smokers walking down the street while smoking create drifting smoke that affects nearby pedestrians. If the government continues expanding smoke-free zones without providing a sufficient number of designated smoking areas, smokers will have nowhere to go, inevitably would increase such behavior. A balanced approach like setting up clear, accessible smoking zones and strengthening enforcement to reduce the “trainhead” issue and protect the rights of both smokers and non-smokers.",
      "The growing problem of “trainhead” phenomenion has become a frustration for the public. Authorities should establish sufficient smoking areas so that smokers could have designated places to smoke. In parallel, legislation should explicitly prohibit smoking while walking in crowded pedestrian areas, supported by law enforcement and effective penalties. ",
      "The government aimed to expand smoke-free areas, yet failing to provide sufficient alternatives such as smoking zones. This leaves smokers with no choice but to light up a cigarette while walking — turning them into unwilling “trainheads.” This suggest that current policies are overly idealistic and disconnected from real-world needs when the strategy is solely about prohibition without providing alternatives.",
      "Most smokers actually do not want to become “trainheads,” nor do they wish for their needs to negatively affect others. Rather than broadly criticizing all smokers, a more practical solution should be pursued — such as creating more convenient smoking areas, providing clear signage, and strengthening patrols to tackle “trainhead” behavior on the streets. Only through mutual understanding and respect can we truly improve the way we share and coexist in public spaces.",
      "What non-smokers care about most is exposure to second-hand smoke caused by “trainhead” smokers, rather than the type or flavor of tobacco products. The government should prioritize regulating smoking behavior at designated smoking areas and a clear ban on “trainhead”. A genuine tobacco control should not just enforce product bans, but creating a fair and liveable public environment for all, while this is the most effective way to protect non-smokers and respecting the rights of smokers. "

    "Failure to Differentiate Between ‘Space Oil’ Drugs and E-cigarette Products": [
      "Recent news reports have shown that multiple teenagers were arrested for using ‘Space Oil,’ highlighting a lack of public awareness regarding such drugs.",
      "Current government policies treat e-cigarettes and ‘Space Oil’ as the same issue, failing to effectively educate the public on how to differentiate between the two.",
      "When legal nicotine e-cigarettes are banned, consumers cannot purchase safe products through regulated markets, leading to rampant black-market transactions.",
      "The government should focus on education and regulation, ensuring consumers can distinguish between legitimate nicotine products and ‘Space Oil.’",
      "Many e-cigarette users have no connection to ‘Space Oil’ at all, yet current policies stigmatize these regular consumers unnecessarily."
    ],
    "Lack of Long-term Public Education Plans": [
      "Legal restrictions alone cannot sustainably reduce smoking rates, as smoking habits involve physiological dependence, psychological factors, and social influences.",
      "The government should allocate resources to comprehensive health education programs rather than relying solely on strict regulations to restrict smoking.",
      "The government should collaborate with medical experts, academic institutions, and non-governmental organizations to launch large-scale public awareness campaigns.",
      "Without a long-term public education plan, smokers will struggle to access accurate information, reducing their chances of successfully quitting smoking.",
      "Smokers are not necessarily unwilling to quit but often lack accurate information and appropriate support. The government should provide more smoking cessation assistance rather than merely increasing tobacco taxes."
