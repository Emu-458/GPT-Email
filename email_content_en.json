    "Dear Members of the Legislative Council,",
    "To the relevant departments of the Hong Kong SAR Government,",
    "Dear Government Officials,",

  ],
  "endingParagraphs": [
    "I hope you will seriously consider the voices of the public.",
    "I urge the government to carefully review its policies.",

    "Please listen to public opinion and make a more reasonable and fair decision."

  "issues": {
    "Serious Illicit Cigarette Problem": [
      "The expansion of the illicit cigarette market has become a serious public policy issue. Overly restricting legal tobacco products will only push consumers toward unregulated black-market products, resulting in tax revenue losses.",
      "Current policies have led many smokers to purchase illicit cigarettes, which are unregulated and may contain harmful substances, posing greater health risks.",
      "The government should strengthen border controls, enhance enforcement against cigarette smuggling, and impose harsher penalties on illegal tobacco trade.",
      "Data shows that the illicit cigarette market is continuously expanding—does this indicate a failure of government strategy? Should excessively strict policies be reconsidered?",
      "The goal of tobacco control is to protect public health, but excessive restrictions are driving smokers towards illicit markets, exposing them to even higher risks."
    ],
    "Excessively High Tobacco Tax": [
      "Further increasing tobacco taxes will impose greater economic pressure on low-income groups and may drive more people to the illegal tobacco market.",
      "Tobacco taxes are already exorbitantly high, prompting many smokers to opt for cheaper illicit tobacco products, which impacts government tax revenues.",
      "The government should focus on providing better smoking cessation support, such as reducing the cost of cessation products and offering free cessation counseling, rather than simply raising tobacco taxes.",
      "The government repeatedly increases tobacco taxes—is this truly for public health, or simply to generate more tax revenue?",
      "Many smokers are not unwilling to quit but lack proper support. Excessively high tobacco taxes only add financial stress and may even encourage black-market transactions."
    ],
    "Ban on Flavored Tobacco Products": [
      "Banning flavored tobacco products may lead consumers to turn to illicit cigarette markets rather than effectively reducing smoking rates.",
      "Research shows that the primary reason people start smoking is nicotine dependence, not the flavor of tobacco.",
      "The government should focus on education and smoking cessation support rather than simply banning flavored tobacco, to avoid unintentionally encouraging black-market trade.",
      "When the legal market fails to meet consumer demand, the illegal market naturally rises, leading to more severe public health risks.",
      "In a mature society, adults should have the right to choose rather than being unilaterally deprived of legal product options by the government."
    ],
    "Ban on E-cigarettes and Heated Tobacco Products": [
      "Many countries have recognized e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products as harm reduction tools and have implemented regulations to ensure their safety.",
      "If the government completely bans e-cigarettes and heated tobacco, many smokers may revert to traditional cigarettes, leading to more severe health issues.",
      "A black market for e-cigarette products may emerge, and these unregulated products could contain even more dangerous substances.",
      "The government should establish strict regulatory measures rather than outright banning e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products to safeguard public health.",
      "Many smokers have successfully reduced their use of traditional cigarettes or even quit smoking through e-cigarettes; the government should provide appropriate choices."
    ],
    "Ban on Hookah (Waterpipe)": [
      "Hookah has a certain market in bars and the catering industry. A total ban would economically impact related industries, affecting employment and consumption.",
      "A strict ban on hookah may lead to the expansion of illegal markets, allowing unregulated products to enter circulation, thereby increasing health risks.",
      "Instead of outright banning hookah, the government could implement a licensing system to allow designated venues to legally offer hookah services.",
      "Hookah has become a cultural trend in Hong Kong and neighboring cities—has the government considered this phenomenon?",
      "Many people view hookah as a social activity. A direct ban may not effectively reduce its use but could drive people to unregulated venues."
    ],
    "Expansion of No-smoking Areas Without Providing Legal Smoking Zones": [
      "The purpose of expanding no-smoking areas is to improve public spaces, but without designated smoking areas, smokers will have nowhere to go.",
      "If the government does not provide legal smoking areas, smokers will be forced to smoke in unsuitable places, such as back alleys and stairwells, affecting social order.",
      "The government could establish designated smoking areas in specific locations, such as designated zones within parks, to ensure smokers have appropriate spaces.",
      "If the government enforces smoking bans without providing legal smoking areas, does this mean the policy has not fully considered the rights of smokers?",
      "The original intention of smoking bans is to improve public environments, but without legal smoking areas, unintended negative consequences may arise."
    ],
    "Failure to Differentiate Between ‘Space Oil’ Drugs and E-cigarette Products": [
      "Recent news reports have shown that multiple teenagers were arrested for using ‘Space Oil,’ highlighting a lack of public awareness regarding such drugs.",
      "Current government policies treat e-cigarettes and ‘Space Oil’ as the same issue, failing to effectively educate the public on how to differentiate between the two.",
      "When legal nicotine e-cigarettes are banned, consumers cannot purchase safe products through regulated markets, leading to rampant black-market transactions.",
      "The government should focus on education and regulation, ensuring consumers can distinguish between legitimate nicotine products and ‘Space Oil.’",
      "Many e-cigarette users have no connection to ‘Space Oil’ at all, yet current policies stigmatize these regular consumers unnecessarily."
    ],
    "Lack of Long-term Public Education Plans": [
      "Legal restrictions alone cannot sustainably reduce smoking rates, as smoking habits involve physiological dependence, psychological factors, and social influences.",
      "The government should allocate resources to comprehensive health education programs rather than relying solely on strict regulations to restrict smoking.",
      "The government should collaborate with medical experts, academic institutions, and non-governmental organizations to launch large-scale public awareness campaigns.",
      "Without a long-term public education plan, smokers will struggle to access accurate information, reducing their chances of successfully quitting smoking.",
      "Smokers are not necessarily unwilling to quit but often lack accurate information and appropriate support. The government should provide more smoking cessation assistance rather than merely increasing tobacco taxes."
